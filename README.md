_Megamania tribute game using only with P5js (Javascript)_

This is an Atari´s game made by Activision back on 1982. I realy love this game and I grew up playing it (and a couple of others) with my mother and my uncle.
This is my very simple tribute to the original game. ACTIVISION, please don´t get me wrong because the joking with your company name (and my name). Activison, I ❤ you!

The controls is pretty simple but I forgot to put it on the screen, sorry by my fault:
- Move horizontally with the ARROW KEYS: ⬅➡
- Shoot with the SPACE BAR
- Pause the game with the CTRL key

The game loops on the first enemy so, when you kill all of then, it will reload.
This is my first experience with P5js, wich I enjoyed a lot. P5js, I ❤ you too!
