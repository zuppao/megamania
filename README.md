_Megamania tribute game using only P5js (Javascript)_

This is an Atari´s game made by [**Activision**](https://www.activision.com) back on 1982 ([**Megamania**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megamania)). I really love this game, I grew up playing it (and a couple of others) with my mother and my uncle.
This is my very simple tribute to the original one. ACTIVISION, please don´t get me wrong because the joking with your company name (and my name). Activison, I ❤ you!

The controls is pretty simple ~~_but I forgot to put it on the screen, sorry by my fault_ (yeah, fixed)~~:
- Move horizontally with ARROW KEYS: ⬅➡ or with A / D keys
- Shoot with SPACE BAR or ⬆ key
- Pause the game with CTRL key

The game always loops with the first enemy/phase so, when you kill them all, it will be reloaded.
This is my first experience with [**P5js**](https://p5js.org), wich I enjoyed a lot. P5js, I ❤ you too!
